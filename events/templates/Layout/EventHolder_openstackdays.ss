                        <p>
                            Are you interested in hosting an #OpenStack #AppHack in your area?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First, get in touch with your local user group or community ambassador to see if there are already events happening and how you can get plugged in. You can reference the <a href="//groups.openstack.org/groups" target="_blank">list of user groups</a> and <a href="//groups.openstack.org/ambassador-program" target="_blank">ambassadors</a> to find one near you. Hackathons require quite a bit of work (and lots of helpers) to organize, so read our handy #AppHack brochure to get started.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, <a href="//www.openstack.org/brand/event-policy/">review the event guidelines</a>.  OpenStack Cloud Application Hackathons are non-commercial events and we expect them to run in accordance with the spirit of the community. This means making reasonable efforts to open the events to anyone in the community who wants to help organize, attend, or sponsor, regardless of affiliation. It also means avoiding sales pitches and focusing on visionary, educational and user-driven content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The OpenStack Foundation can help support your OpenStack AppHack with funding, content and promotion. Once you’ve reviewed the guidelines, please contact <a href="mailto:events@openstack.org">events@openstack.org</a> to get started.

                        <p class="question">
                            Can anyone host an AppHack event?
                        </p>
                        <p class="answer">
                            AppHack events are typically hosted by local user groups, but anyone can get involved. If you are interested in starting a new OpenStack communinty in your area, it’s best to get in touch with your <a href="//groups.openstack.org">local user group or regional ambassador</a>. In order to use the “OpenStack Cloud Application Hackathon” brand, you must get approval from the OpenStack Foundation and meet <a href="//www.openstack.org/brand/event-policy/">the event guidelines</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="question">
                            Who attends AppHack events?
                        </p>
                        <p class="answer">
                            OpenStack Day events vary based on the organizers and local communities. Some events are more focused on business issues and cloud strategy, while some are more focused on technical operators and developers. Most events attract a few hundred attendees, but the largest event had more than 1,500 participants. Most annual events grow and attract new participants each year, so it’s OK to start on the smaller end and build over time.
                        </p>
                        <p class="question">
                            How can the OpenStack Foundation help?
                        </p>
                        <p class="answer">
                            Once an event is approved, the Foundation typically provides sponsorship funding (up to 5,000 USD depending on the size of the event), logos and digital branding assets, support attracting key hackathon trainers in the community and promotion. Please contact <a href="mailto:events@openstack.org">events@openstack.org</a> for more information and to get started.
